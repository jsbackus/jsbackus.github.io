For years now I've tossed around the idea of setting up a personal site and 
blog. Usually, I would get a burst of inspiration after running into a problem,
generally Linux-based, that I eventually figured out after banging my head 
against the wall. But before I could get around to doing anything with that
solution, I would invariably become distracted by Yet Another Shiny
Object&trade; and that was that.

So, I've finally gotten around to it. "Why now?" you may ask, after The 
Internet&trade; has moved on to Facebook, or Twitter, or Medium, or whatever? 
Well, I'm usually late to the party, regardless of the occasion. Actually, I'm
usually *really* late to the party. But the nice thing about showing up
to a party long after everyone else has gone home is that you get to pick the 
music - although you usually have to order your own pizza, which is a bummer.

In all seriousness, it was a confluence of things. For one, the thought has 
been on my mind a lot more recently than usual. Additionally, I've been 
tinkering with several things that I thought would be helpful to post somewhere
on the internet, if for no other reason than so that I can find them later when
I need them and can't remember any of the details -  and I happened to actually
make notes this time.

What finally pushed me over the edge was Google Code closing down, 
interestingly enough. Years ago I wrote a few screen savers and released on
Google Code, complete with a Google Pages site for them. Well, since Google 
Code is joining the great GeoCities in the sky, I decided to A) move the
repository to GitHub to join various other projects that I've started, and B)
find a new home for project page as well as the poor excuse for a home page I
put up when I started 
[The Idle Screen Project](https://github.com/jsbackus/idlescreen).

In looking around for a place to move the project page I ran across Jekyll, 
which piqued my interest. The fact that it is simple, uses an open source,
markdown-based engine that plays well with Git and is easy to set up and demo
at home - well, what's not to like? Particularly for a person who still keeps 
various notes and brainstorming lists in LaTeX. (Yes, I'm one of *those* 
people.)

So, anyway, we'll see where this goes. Stay tuned for what I hope are 
interesting and/or useful posts on various open source- and tech-related topics
that keep distracting me from actually moving that fool screen saver page and 
properly setting up the repository.
