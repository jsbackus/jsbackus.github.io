Hi. I'm yet another techie meandering through that boundless collection of 
tubes affectionally known as the internet. In addition to an inexhaustable
curiosity and a penchant for breaking things, I have degrees in electrical 
engineering, computer engineering, and computer science. 
While my day job at a large semiconductor company provides me with a 
wonderful balance between hardware and software and a cornicopia of things to
explore, it doesn't give me much of an opportunity to contribute to the open 
source community. 

Open source has long been an interest of mine, both as a user, a tinkerer,
and a programmer. This site is my outlet for open source and other tech errata,
for my ramblings and musings on whatever shiny thing has my attention at
the moment.
