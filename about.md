Hi, my name is Jeff Backus. I am an electrical engineer with a large 
semiconductor company. I have degrees in electrical engineering, computer
engineering, and computer science.

While my day job provides me with a wonderful balance between hardware and 
software, it doesn't give me much of an opportunity to contribute to the open
source community.
